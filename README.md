# Userstyles
A repository with my userstyles that I wrote, mostly for Google Chat.
## Userstyles index
### [Google Chat Teams](https://github.com/JakubMzTrencina/Userstyles/blob/main/GoogleChat/GoogleChatTeams.css)
This userstyle makes Google Chat look similar to Microsoft Teams. It's not a perfect Microsoft Teams copy, though. Also, this userstyle works only for dark mode yet!
### [Google Chat: No More Deleted Messages](https://github.com/JakubMzTrencina/Userstyles/blob/main/GoogleChat/NoMoreDeletedMessages.css)
This userstyle hides the annoying "This message was deleted by its author" from Google Chat. It is compatible with dark mode and light mode.
### [Upside-down Google Chat](https://github.com/JakubMzTrencina/Userstyles/blob/main/GoogleChat/UpsideDownGoogleChat.css)
I think this is self-explanatory.
